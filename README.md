# Expense Manager
# This is a simple text-based program that allows users to track their expenses.
# Users are given the options to add a new expense, view their current expenses, remove an old expense, or exit the program.
# Each 'expense' object has a description, amount (in dollars), date, and category, all inputed by the user in the terminal.

# I created this program for a college assignment, to demonstrate my understanding of the basics of Java.
# The program was made in one-and-a-half days, so it may be written with poor practices.
# For what it's worth, I got an A+ on the assignment.
